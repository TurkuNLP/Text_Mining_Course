# Sentiment detection

One of the most typical projects that will land on your desk, especially if you work for a .ai or .io company, is sentiment detection of various kinds. So let's try what can be achieved on this front. In this project you will be asked to test building a sentiment detection system.

## Milestone I - English track

There are a number of ready-made English sentiment datasets in the wild. For example [here](https://blog.cambridgespark.com/50-free-machine-learning-datasets-sentiment-analysis-b9388f79c124) are mentioned several, and that is just one of a number of similar lists. Summarize the existing datasets in terms of what is available, and how these datasets differ from each other. Pick two interesting ones from different domains and train a sentiment classifier on them. Report results.

## Milestone II - English track

Make a cross-domain study. Train on one dataset, test on another one from a different domain. Report what happens to the results and draw conclusions about the transferability of trained sentiment classifiers across different domains.
