        "The annotation target is a general [`ORG-Affiliation`](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sites/www.ldc.upenn.edu/files/english-relations-guidelines-v6.2.pdf#page=21) relation that can hold between a `PERSON` mention and an `ORG` mention. The following are examples of specific `ORG-Affiliation` relations:\n",

        "More generally, any _lasting_ relationship between a person and an organization can be annotated as `ORG-Affiliation`. By contrast, coincidental or momentary associations between a person and an organization should **not** be annotated as `ORG-Affiliation`:\n",

        "* **Annotate for what is said, not what you know**: if you encounter familiar associations (e.g. _Elon Musk_, _Tesla_), try to forget them and consider if the association could be inferred from the text\n",
        "* **Don't look for corner cases**: annotate what a reasonable reader would assume the meaning of the sentence to be in a general context\n",
        "* **Don't overthink your decisions**: once you've read the example, your initial understanding is likely correct\n",
        "* **Try to maintain a steady pace**: if you find yourself stuck, pick `ignore` in preference of spending a long time on any single example\n",
        "* **Expect negatives and errors**: the data is a random sample of pairs that have been annotated by an imperfect automatic tool; select `ignore` whenever something appears wrong in NE annotation"
