# Make money on annotation

We are looking for a little annotation help on a news robotics project. The task will be to pair hockey statistics and corresponding sentences in Finnish hockey news articles. The purpose of the annotation is to produce training data for sports news generation with deep neural networks. You will be expected to spend on the task 3 weeks full-time equivalent but for example a half-time effort over six weeks is fine as well. You need to speak Finnish and we would need this started ASAP, as early as 8.4. We can offer the trainee salary which is about 1300â‚¬ per working month.

Please send a very brief "who am I" letter to Filip (figint@utu.fi) and Jenna (jmnybl@utu.fi) before Thursday 4.4.
