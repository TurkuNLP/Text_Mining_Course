    "* Text data acquisition, typical sources, and pre-processing\n",
    "  * Grabbing sizeable portions of text data from various sources: Wikidumps, Web forum, CommonCrawl, Suomi24 research data, Pubmed, twitter,...\n",
    "  * Getting from raw text data into something which can be reasonably processed downstream\n",
    "  * Materials on GitHub: [Elementary text processing](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/Text_Mining_Course/blob/master/Elementary%20text%20processing.ipynb) [Text sources](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/Text_Mining_Course/blob/master/Text%20sources.ipynb)\n",
    "* Text classification and clustering\n",
    "  * How can we label texts with topics, sentiment, etc?\n",
    "  * How can we find meaningful topic clusters in large text collections?\n",
    "* Relations and Information Extraction\n",

    "* Scientific literature mining a prime non-evil example:\n",
    "* [www.evexdb.org](www.evexdb.org)\n",
    "  * Dozens of millions of interactions among genes/proteins extracted from millions of scientific articles\n",
    "  * Gives the \"big picture\"\n",
    "  * Allows search going far beyond keywords\n",
    "  * Allows generation of new hypotheses\n",
    "  * In: pure text  Out: network of known relations between genes and proteins\n",
    "* Customer feedback and review sentiment analysis\n",
    "  * What went right, what went wrong\n",
    "  * How is my company / product / idea / opinion received by others?\n",
    "* Faster access to information: cluster and label topics, views, opinions\n",
    "* Scarily accurate Ad placement by Google\n",
    "* Numerous applications in security\n",
    "* User/customer profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference from traditional data mining is that text is unstructured and a lot more noisy than your usual relational database. \n",
