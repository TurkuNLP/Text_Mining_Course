    "* How to pass the course?\n",
    "  * Hand out the exercises (min. 1/2)\n",
    "  * Hand out the course project, which will get you a grade between 1 and 3 depending on how far in the project you get\n",
    "  * Optional Q&A session after project hand-out to reach grades 4 or 5\n",
    "  * No exam in the traditional sense\n",

    "## Course server\n",
    "\n",
    "All course work will happen on the linux server `vm0964.kaj.pouta.csc.fi`. Accounts for those who have signed up for the course have been created and passwords will be given in the class. The way to access the machine is `ssh`.\n",

    "\n",
    "This being an advanced level course, we assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some knowledge of programming (all our stuff will be in Python)\n",
    "* Some idea of the linux environment\n",
    "* Many of the examples will focus on handling the Finnish language but we will always provide an English alternative as well\n",
    "* The students are a mix of different backgrounds, so we do expect everyone's interests will differ and that is fine\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topics (with links to materials)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text data acquisition, typical sources, and pre-processing\n",
    "  * Grabbing sizeable portions of text data from various sources: Wikidumps, Web forum, CommonCrawl, Suomi24 research data, Pubmed, twitter,...\n",
    "  * Getting from raw text data into something which can be reasonably processed downstream\n",
    "  * Materials on GitHub: [Text sources](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/Text_Mining_Course/blob/master/Text%20sources.ipynb)[Elementary text processing](https://github.com/TurkuNLP/Text_Mining_Course/blob/master/Elementary%20text%20processing.ipynb) \n",
    "* Text classification and clustering\n",
    "  * How can we label texts with topics, sentiment, etc?\n",
    "  * How can we find meaningful topic clusters in large text collections?\n",
    "* Relations and Information Extraction\n",
    "  * Finding entities of interest in text\n",
    "  * How can we find meaningful relations between these entities?\n",
    "  * How can we infer new relations?\n",

    "# So what's this course all about?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text mining: aggregate information from massive text collections to gain new insights\n",
    "* Scientific literature mining a prime non-evil example:\n",
    "* [www.evexdb.org](www.evexdb.org)\n",
    "  * Dozens of millions of interactions among genes/proteins extracted from millions of scientific articles\n",
    "  * Gives the \"big picture\"\n",
    "  * Allows search going far beyond keywords\n",
    "  * Allows generation of new hypotheses\n",
    "  * In: pure text  Out: network of known relations between genes and proteins\n",
    "* Customer feedback and review sentiment analysis\n",
    "  * What went right, what went wrong\n",
    "  * How is my company / product / idea / opinion received by others?\n",
    "* Faster access to information: cluster and label topics, views, opinions\n",
    "* Scarily accurate Ad placement by Google\n",
    "* Numerous applications in security\n",
    "* User/customer profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference from traditional data mining is that text is unstructured and a lot more noisy than your usual relational database. \n"
